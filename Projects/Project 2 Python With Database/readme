In this project, I have to create a digital phone book as we do in our old times, and I have to make this thing with the help of a database in this project I am using.
PostgreSQL and connect this with python.
Now Let's Talk About How To Do this project:
1. I have to create a login system
2. I have to create a registration for the database
3. then ask a user to enter a username and password if it is available in my database, then log in; otherwise, give the registration option
4. In registration, I will ask the user to enter their username and password for username and then create a database with the help of these credentials
5. Then I have to give them options like:
   What you want to do:
   1. View Contacts
   2. Add Contact
   3. Search Contact
   4. Delete Contact
   5. Update Contact
   
So with the help of python, I write all code, connect with the database, create a table, and add all these things to the table. So yeah, that's it.
